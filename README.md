# Shadow-cljs test implementation


## Install
To install shadow-cljs, you may need to make sure Java is installed, or node-jre will be installed since it’s based on Java. But don’t worry, you don’t have to play with Java.

Then install shadow-js and local dependencies with npm:

```
npm install
npm install -g shadow-cljs
```

## Development
```
shadow-cljs watch app
```
